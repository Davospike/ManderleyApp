# Manderley

An app I developed for my Masters final project. It was designed to help young men to collect and reflect on data surrounding their health and well-being by using sentiment analysis on user entered text to ascertain its sentiment, and allowed for the collection of various data points such as current mood and the amount of sleep an exercise someone has had throughout the day. It hoped to provide insights on an individual's health and well-being, aiming to provide a way to positive change by helping users recognise when their mental health is failing, and aiding them in acting accordingly. 

## Objectives and Challenges 
- Create a prototype application from which young men can enter and track data surrounding their health and well-being and reflect upon it
- Integrate sentiment analysis, which is to be run on user entered text, into the mobile application
- Ascertain as to whether the inclusion of sentiment analysis has had any impact on users' ability to collect and reflect on data surrounding their health and well-being

## Technology Used
- JavaScript 
- React Native 
- Node.js
- Express
- Natural sentiment analysis library 
- MongoDB 
- Expo
- Firebase
- Amplitude
